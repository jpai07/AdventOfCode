# Advent of Code

## 1. Repository Origin
This repository is forked from [@henriupton99](https://github.com/henriupton99)'s Advent of Code project, preserving the original utility scripts for retrieving the daily problem and running the solution.py file.

## 2. Project Structure
### 1.1 Utility Scripts:

```bash
#./collect day year
./collect 1 2024
```
retrieves all the content associated to day 1 of year 2024

```bash
#./submit day year part(1/2) test_mode(true/false)
./submit 1 2024 1 true
```
runs solution.py and collects the answer for part 1 (third argument) for test mode set to true (fourth argument)

## 3. Purpose
Learning and problem-solving journey through Advent of Code challenges

## Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding challenge created by Eric Wastl, featuring daily programming puzzles throughout December.
